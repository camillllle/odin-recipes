        <p><em>a traditional take on the popular dish</em></p>
        <p>fried rice is a widespread dish. however, almost every recipe i see is very americanized. it always tastes good, but it is very different from authentic fried rice.</p>
        <p>this dish is an authentic take on fried rice. it is pretty different from the fried rice many know, just to warn you. it doesn't use soy sauce or sesame oil, and the toppings are pretty different from the ones you can get at panda express.</p>
